Based around Poco F2 Pro phone

C-mount lens mount bought, but custom trimmed for appropriate back focusing distance

Lens used is 75mm f/1.4, covering image circle of 2/3", equivalent optical focal length of 341mm (or around 14.5x optical zoom)

Battery is bought, but an effort is made to fit it all inside a thicker body of a phone

Models are attached, and folders for images of the product (or steps in between) and photos taken by the phone are available
